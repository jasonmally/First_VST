# First_VST
I'm developing a VST plugin to handle MIDI data in music recording and production.  As a musician working on my first recording project, I have found various VSTs useful in mixing and synthesizing sounds for my songs.   After finding Martin Finke's blog, I decided to try to create one of my own.  Major props: http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/tags/making_audio_plugins.html for the tutorials.
Thanks to Cockos and Oli Larkin (https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol) for the IPlug audio plugin framework.
Thanks to Steinberg for the VST code library, and to McGill's Schulich School of Music for the RtAudio ASIO library.

# First_VST
Building a VST plugin to handle MIDI data in music recording and production.  As a musician working on my first recording project, I have found various VSTs useful in mixing and synthesizing sounds for my songs.   After finding Martin Finke's blog, I decided to try to create one of my own.  Major props: http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/tags/making_audio_plugins.html
